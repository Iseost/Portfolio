              Project exam, where I was required to use all of the skills that
              you have learned this year at FED1 (frontend first year) including
              design, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Project brief: You have been
              hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API
              blogging application. The client has asked for a responsive
              application that allows users to view dynamic blog posts. The
              client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their
              blog posts. The page is build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
              design by me.
